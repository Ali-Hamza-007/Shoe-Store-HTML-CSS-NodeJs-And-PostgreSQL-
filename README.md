# 👟 Shoe Store Web Application

It is a full-stack shoe store web application developed using **HTML, CSS, Node.js, and PostgreSQL**.  
This project demonstrates how a **pre-designed UI** can be transformed into a **fully functional e-commerce store** by implementing complete backend logic and database integration.
